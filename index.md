## About Myself

I am currently pursuing Masters in Department of Computational and Data Sciences at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. I am currently working on Parallel Algebraic Solvers for Extreme Scale Systems. 

## Background

I completed my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from S V National Institute of Technology, Surat in 2018. My area of interests are Parallel Computing and Machine Learning.


## Projects

### Design of Parallel Algebraic Multigrid Solvers for CPU-GPU Environments
- Aim is to design a parallel algebraic multigrid solver to solve system of linear equations using graph centric approach for accelerator equipped distributed computing systems for Exascale Computing
-  Improvement of upto 2X is obtained over Intel MKL Pardiso Solver in Sequential Case
-  Improvement of upto 10X is obtained for Graph coarsening operations when offloaded to GPU

### Attention Based Pointer Generator Networks for Text Summarization
- Implemented Encoder Decoder GRU based Model with different types of attention mechanisms and Pointer Generator Networks.
- Rouge Score (F1-Score) of 31.17 is obtained on summarizing small paragraphs

### Parallel Graph Coarsening on CPU-GPU Architectures
- Reformulated the graph coarsening operation into equivalent linear algebra BLAS-3 operation on adjacency matrix
- Obtained speedup of 10X on combined CPU-GPU system over CPU environment

### Data Analysis of CPU and GPU Architectures}{Data Analysis and Visualization
- Random Forest Regression Model with Bootstrap Sampling is used to predict  power requirement of architectures as a function of its specifications
- Able to predict power requirement within 20% error from the specifications

## Skills
- Programming Languages: C++, Python
- Object Oriented Programming, Template Metaprogramming
- Familar with Scientific Software Libraries like BLAS, LAPACK, SCALAPACK
- Eclipse Debugger and Intel VTune Profiler
- Parallel Programming Libraries OpenMP, MPI and CUDA programming
- Machine Learning and Deep Learning Frameworks - Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow
- Git Version Control
